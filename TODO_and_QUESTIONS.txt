Questions

1) what is the overall weather (precipitation) trend? over the span of the data, is it raining less each year?

2) when is the deadline? when must this be presented?

To Do
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1) maintain the organization where each row of the data corresponds to a unique rain event. which is actually an individual "rain day". 

2) The structure of the data is really fucking me up.  Each tree needs a unique ID.  But it should also have a treatment label, a block label, though I think the plot label is superfluous.
