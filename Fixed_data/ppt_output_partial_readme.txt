ppt_output_partial.csvThis is the successor to "all_data_ppt_pulse.csv". I changed the filename because I have added four columns which are not the last columns, so I didn't want to inadvertently confuse the R code.All plots are included here. The moisture release curves used to generate deep soil VWC on P9-12 are pretty ugly, but hopefully not disastrously so. Anyways, we have numbers!The columns added are for mean volumetric water content (shallow pre/post and deep pre/post). So in this file there are entries where we have Js pre/post for a tree but no tree-specific VWC. So any time there is Js data before and after a pulse, and the datalogger running the VWC sensors on that plot was up and running, it will be included in this table.The Js_delta error is fixed.I am also working on a "ppt_output_complete.csv" file for the entries where we have tree-specific VWC data to match the Js data. That table will probably be about one-third of the length of this one, with significant under-representation of drought plots (6 and 10 most notably). I just need to incorporate the spatial information to infer VWC when possible.
