Hello Jen,Here are the distances from the Bare sensor locations to the nearest trees in Plots 9-12.Ê The distances were taken from sensor to sensor, i.e Bare Echo profile to Tree Echo profile.Ê The sensors at a given location were sometimes spread-out, the EC5 profile at a Bare location might be 50cm or more from the sychrometer sensors for the same location, so we measured from the approximate "center" of the sensors, equal distance from both sensor sets for a given loction (profile and sychrometer).Ê Let me know if you need more info or if the following is confusing.Plot 9Bare 1 to Tree #1 = 6.3 metersBare 1 to Tree #2 = 3.4mBare 1 to Tree #5 = 1.6mBare 1 to Tree #7 = 3.3mBare 1 to Tree #10 = 7.4mBare 2 to Tree #3 = 2.7mBare 2 to Tree #8 = 4.8mBare 2 to Tree #10 = 5mBare 3 to Tree #4 = 3.8mBare 3 to Tree #9 = 3.3mBare 3 to Tree #10 = 8.2mBare 3 to Tree #8 = 7.7mBare 4 to Tree #10 = 4.4mBare 4 to Tree #9 = 7.3mBare 4 to Tree #5 = 6.5mBare 4 to Tree #7 = 8.8mBare 5 to Tree #7 = 3.8mBare 5 to Tree #5 = 4.0mPlot 10Bare 1 to Tree #6 = 9.8mBare 1 to Tree #1 = 11.1mBare 1 to Tree #10 = 9.5mBare 2 to Tree #4 = 4.6mBare 2 to Tree #7 = 4.6mBare 2 to Tree #2 = 4.0mBare 3 to Tree #7 = 2.9mBare 3 to Tree #4 = 6.1mBare 3 to Tree #2 = 6.2mBare 4 to Tree #8 = 6.7mBare 4 to Tree #4 = 7.6mBare 5 to Tree #9 = 5.0mBare 5 to Tree #10 = 4.7mPlot 11Bare 1 to Tree #8 = 3.2mBare 1 to Tree #9 = 3.8mBare 1 to Tree #6 = 5.2mBare 2 to Tree #4 = 3.0mBare 2 to Tree #10 = 6.3mBare 3 to Tree #10 = 4.1mBare 3 to Tree #4 = 7.3mBare 4 to Tree #1 = 4.5mBare 4 to Tree #2 = 7.0mBare 4 to Tree #3 = 5.0mBare 5 to Tree #10 = 6.0mBare 5 to Tee #4 = 5.7m Plot 12Bare 1 to Tree #7 = 5.4mBare 1 to Tree #1 = 7.3mBare 1 to Tree #2 = 5.7mBare 2 to Tree #3 = 6.6mBare 2 to Tree #9 = 5.9mBare 3 to Tree #10 = 5.0mBare 3 to Tree #4 = 4.9mBare 3 to Tree #5 = 7.5mBare 3 to Tree #6 = 7.1mBare 4 to Tree #5 = 2.8mBare 4 to Tree #9 = 9.7mBare 4 to Tree #4 = 6.4mBare 5 to Tree #5 = 6.6mBare 5 to Tree #6 = 4.2mBare 5 to Tree #1 = 4.0m
